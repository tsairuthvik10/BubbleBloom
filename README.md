✨ Core Concept
Bubble Bloom transforms real-world scanned locations into magical, playable gardens. Players find and pop bubbles to create satisfying chain reactions, scoring points based on skill and strategy. Successful combos are rewarded by growing persistent, beautiful AR plants directly onto the real-world mesh.

Our Design Philosophy: "What You Care For, Grows"
The game is designed around a subtle environmental message. Instead of lectures, this is delivered through mechanics. The AR gardens players grow are a direct result of their skillful play and engagement. The act of playing—of caring for the space—is what brings beauty and life into the world. This creates a gentle, positive feedback loop that encourages a sense of ownership and stewardship over the player's local digital environment.

🔁 Game Loop Flow
The core gameplay is a session-based loop designed for tension and reward. The player's goal is to survive the countdown timer by creating chain reactions to add more time, achieving the highest score possible.

⚙️ How to Run
The project is built with Unity 2022.3.x LTS. The startup logic is handled by the GameCoordinator.cs script, which has a simple toggle to switch between modes.

Editor Test Scene:

Open the Unity Project.

Navigate to the scene: _Scenes/Game_Development_Scene.

Select the GameCoordinator GameObject in the Hierarchy.

In the Inspector, ensure Is Editor Test Mode is checked ON.

Press Play. You can use your mouse to simulate taps.

Final AR Build:

The final build uses a clean duplicate of the Augg.io Main Scene, named OnSite_AR_Scene.

In this scene, select the GameCoordinator GameObject.

In the Inspector, ensure Is Editor Test Mode is checked OFF.

Set the Expected Anchor Count In AR to match the number of anchors placed in the Augg.io CMS.

🛠️ Technical Architecture
Platform: Unity Engine with the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

AR Framework: Augg.io SDK for real-world LiDAR scanning, cloud anchor management, and on-site localization.

Core Gameplay:

Anchor-Based Spawning: A custom BubbleClusterSpawner generates dynamic bubble puzzles in a radius around each real-world cloud anchor.

Chain-Reaction Engine: A performant system for calculating and visualizing combo chains with animated "energy trails."

Game Coordinator: A robust central controller manages the game state, ensuring the timer only starts after all bubbles have been procedurally spawned.

Backend: Google Firebase (Firestore) for a persistent, scalable global leaderboard system with anonymous user authentication.

🚀 Future Work
Real-time Multiplayer: Implementing shared "Golden Bubbles" that all players in an area can race to pop.

AI-Generated Content: Using the Gemini API to generate unique lore and descriptions for each plant the player grows.

Deeper Progression: Adding a Daily Quest system and long-term Achievements to drive player retention.
