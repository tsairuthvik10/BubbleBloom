## ‚ú® Core Concept

Bubble Bloom transforms real-world scanned locations into magical, playable gardens.  
Players find and pop bubbles to create satisfying chain reactions, scoring points based on skill and strategy.

**Our Design Philosophy:**  
*"What You Care For, Grows"*

- The game delivers a subtle environmental message through mechanics, not lectures.
- AR gardens grow as a direct result of the player‚Äôs skill and engagement.
- The more you nurture your virtual garden, the more it flourishes.

## üîÅ Game Loop Flow

The core gameplay is a session-based loop designed for tension and reward.  
The player's goal: **Survive the countdown timer by creating chain reactions to add more time and achieve the highest score possible.**

### Game Loop Steps

1. **Round Begins**
   - Timer starts at 30s

2. **Player Pops a Bubble**
   - A combo chain is initiated

3. **Chain Reaction Spreads**
   - Score increases
   - Time increases

4. **Combo Ends (Times Out)**
   - If combo > 3, a üå± Plant grows

5. **Loop Back to Step 2**
   - Player finds a new bubble

#### Branching

- **If Timer > 0:**  
  - Continue Loop (return to Step 2)
- **If Timer ‚â§ 0:**  
  - Round Over

6. **Score is Submitted**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

The project is built with **Unity 2022.3.x LTS**.

### Editor Test Scene

- Open the Unity Project.
- Navigate to the scene: `_Scenes/Game_Development_Scene`.
- Select the `GameCoordinator` GameObject in the Hierarchy.
- In the Inspector, ensure **Is Editor Test Mode** is checked **ON**.
- Press Play. You can use your mouse to simulate taps.

### Final AR Build

- Uses a clean duplicate of the Augg.io Main Scene, named `OnSite_AR_Scene`.
- In this scene, select the `GameCoordinator` GameObject.
- In the Inspector, ensure **Is Editor Test Mode** is checked **OFF**.
- Set the **Expected Anchor Count In AR** to match the number of anchors placed in the Augg.io CMS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

- **Platform:** Unity Engine with the Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- **AR Framework:** Augg.io SDK for real-world LiDAR scanning, cloud anchor management, and on-site localization

### Core Gameplay Components

- **Anchor-Based Spawning:**  
  Custom `BubbleClusterSpawner` generates dynamic bubble puzzles in a radius around each real-world cloud anchor.
- **Chain-Reaction Engine:**  
  A performant system for calculating and visualizing combo chains with animated "energy trails."
- **Game Coordinator:**  
  A robust central controller manages the game state, ensuring the timer only starts after all bubbles have been procedurally spawned.
- **Backend:**  
  Google Firebase (Firestore) for a persistent, scalable global leaderboard system with anonymous user authentication.

## üöÄ Future Work

- **Real-time Multiplayer:**  
  Implement shared "Golden Bubbles" that all players in an area can race to pop.
- **AI-Generated Content:**  
  Use the Gemini API to generate unique lore and descriptions for each plant the player grows.
- **Deeper Progression:**  
  Add a Daily Quest system and long-term achievements to drive player retention.
